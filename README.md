# CiscoThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [Cisco APIs](http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Cisco_Unity_Connection_Messaging_Interface_%28CUMI%29_API). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [Cisco APIs](http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Cisco_Unity_Connection_Messaging_Interface_%28CUMI%29_API).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Cisco_Unity_Connection_Messaging_Interface_%28CUMI%29_API)- [Developer](http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Cisco_Unity_Connection_Messaging_Interface_%28CUMI%29_API)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cisco)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/cisco/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the Cisco APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
