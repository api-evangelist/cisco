APIs are important for customers because they allow their technical staff and programmers to build tools that help them do their job more effectively (in this case, to keep up with security vulnerability information).\nFor more information about the Cisco PSIRT openVuln API visit https:\/\/developer.cisco.com\/site\/PSIRT\/discover\/overview\n\nFor detail steps on how to use the API go to:https:\/\/developer.cisco.com\/site\/PSIRT\/get-started\/getting-started.gsp\n\nThis is a beta release of a swagger YAML for the Cisco PSIRT openVuln API\n\nTo access the API sign in with your Cisco CCO account at http:\/\/apiconsole.cisco.com and register an application\nto recieve a client_id and a client_secret\n\nYou can then get your token using curl or any other method you prefer.\n\n'curl -s -k -H \"Content-Type: applicati",
